       "I called into Bank5277 s executive office to request a reconsideration of my credit line increase request placed online on XXXXXXXX15 I wa informed by XXXX from there execuitive resolution team that a new manual credit line increase application could be submitted and that they would do a soft pull on my credit I agreed and I requested a credit line increase to 2500000 A few day went by and I noticed that my credit line wa increase by 150000 to 1200000 I called back in and the pin code that XXXX had given me to get to the executive resolution team no longer worked I spoke to a few associate who got me over to XXXX who wa the senior account supervisorsenior customer advocate for capital one When I asked to be connected back to the executive resolution team she informed me that it wa nt an appropriate call to go to there office I asked her if she could have a letter sent out to me like in the past that explains why my credit line wa not increased to the requested amount She put me on hold for quite a long time and came back and said that the executive resolution team doe not provide that information I explained that in the past that I received that from them She called back again and wa told that reason are only provided when a customer chooses not to accept a partial credit line increase So I asked to be transferred again to that department so that I could reapply for an additional manual credit line increase request and this time I would inform them that I would not accept a partial credit line increase so that I could get a letter that tell me why I did not qualify 6 month ago when I have placed this request I wa able to get a letter and the letter said I did not qualify because I did not have similar credit line with other lender Now that I have had similar credit line with other creditor I wa nt to see why they will not approve me for the requested credit amount XXXX reiterated that I did not qualify at this time a the credit line increase wa only approved for a partial amount and stated that it wa the highest I qualified for I indicated that the Equal credit opportunity act requires that my application be taken She indicated that she could get me over to the automated system to fill out the request I told her that I already did that on XXXX and the system will not approve any request for a credit line increase if you have had a change in credit line in the past 6 month which wa confirmed with there executive resolution team That it wa a violation of my right to not transfer me to the team to apply for the manual credit line increase wa discouraging and refusing to take my application for credit If they allow one customer to go through this process they must let all customer go through the process every time they request it When I asked her if she wa refusing to let me speak with someone who could place the request she reiterated she did not believe that it wa appropriate for her to transfer me to the executive resolution team This is a clear violation of fair lending law                                             1\n",
