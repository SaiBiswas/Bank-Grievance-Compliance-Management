# Bank Compliance Management Classification
This is a Text Mining Project on Bank Data Compliance Management System. Generally, the consumer grievances against Banks broadly fall into two categories; “Un-fair and deceptive business practice related (UFDP)” and “efficiency related (not UFDP)”.
It is expected that the Bank monitors compliance management system on a regular basis to “self-identify weaknesses and take corrective 
action” by closing grievance (irrespective of type of grievance) with or without monetary relief etc.  Similarly, where grievance is closed with explanation, resulting in a potential dispute, it is expected that “consumer grievance response” is measured in terms of
effectiveness of communication. I have worked on this data fully and classified the results as "UFDP" or "(not UFDP)".
